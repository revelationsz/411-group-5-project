Project Ideas

Project 1:
Web app that pinpoints playlists from Spotify depending on a music preferences/mood test/weather.
The web app will allow users to create an account on a website and log in to an account to take a 
personality test on a third party website, who’s results would be displayed on our website and based 
on those results our website will display a list of playlists pulled from Spotify for the user to listen to.
