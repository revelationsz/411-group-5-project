Technology Stack Decisions:
- Spotift Web API Node.js

Our team chose to implement Node.js as it provides an extensive list of open source and free packages that aids development and the scalibility and flexibility of the framework. We can add new resources to an existing program or add our new functions to the application. Additionally, we can make changes to the code and only that node.

- Python

Our team decided not to use Python since we have to make three different calls to the frontend, backend, and middleware so it would be too complicated. It is also easier to build frontend components through React.js and Node.js.
